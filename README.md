# web-app-assignment-Yr1UnitConversion

This unit convertor was my end of year project in first year of college.
We were asked to make a web app that had some sort of mathematical calculations in it, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To check it out, download the folder, unzip it if needed, and click index.html
It should be self-explanatory from there.

P.s. sorry about it being basic ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
